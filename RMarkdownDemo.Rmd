## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Begin Lab

Let's start by installing a couple packages (`styler` and `prettycode`) and (optionally) [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which can be used for collaboration and version control. 

```{r}
#install.packages('styler')
#install.packages('prettycode')
library(styler)
library(prettycode)
```

# Style 

Code style is important for readability. One good way to learn is by playing around with the `styler` package. 

```{r non-pretty}
read_file('crappyCode.R')
```

Let's fix it up!   

```{r pretty!}
read_file('crappyCode.R') %>%
  style_text()
```
    
Or... :
```{r whole file}
style_file('crappyCode.R')
```
